# Project Summary
In this project, we will work in small groups to review several React concepts. Your instructor will divide the class into small groups. Each group will work together on a different `.md` file for 20 minutes to learn about a React concept. The goal is for every group to complete the "Remember, Understand and Apply" sections in each of these files. The "Analyze, Evaluate and Create" sections are for extra practice if you have extra time. After 20 minutes, each group will move to the next `.md` file to review a new concept. After every group has completed their review of each React concept, you will spend some time reviewing them collectively as a class.
